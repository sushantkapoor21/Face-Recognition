# Face-Recognition

This project is broadly divided into 2 parts:
1. Face Detection
2. Finding correct predictions

Face detection is done by using the OpenCV haar cascades. You can read about haar cascades [here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2021/04/12/opencv-haar-cascades/).
For finding out predictions **KNN Algorithm** is used.

Libraries used:
1. [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
2. [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
3. [Os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
